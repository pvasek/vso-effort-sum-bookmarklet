# vso-effort-sum-bookmarklet
Simple bookmarklet which goes through your selected backlog 
items and sum the effort.

The effort column needs to be displayed, otherwise this 
will not work.

## Installation
Go to this [link](https://rawgit.com/pvasek/vso-effort-sum-bookmarklet/master/bookmarklet.html) 
and follow the instructions or just drag&drop the **Effort Sum** 
link to your bookmark bar.
